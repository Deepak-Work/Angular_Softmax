# Angular_Softmax
The following code performs image classification on MNIST dataset with DenseNet Architecture using Angular Softmax [pyTorch implementation].

To run the code simply run the "mnist+densenet.py" on python3 terminal.
This is a loose implementation and the lsoftmax function has been derived from Jihun Choi's work: https://github.com/jihunchoi/lsoftmax-pytorch .
A relevent push is appreciated.
